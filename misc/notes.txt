hashing block using SHA256
  > hashing function will hash data and return fixed length string of seemingly random characters using SHA256 crytograph
   > returned hash will always be same for given string

proof of work
  > will take current blocks data (in a hash) then generate a specific hash that will need to meet certain requirement
    > only way to do this is by trial and error
     > will have to run hash block method many times to hit correct hash
      > continuously change nonce value until it finds correct value
       > then return the nonce value which created the correct hash
        > this secures blockchain, as takes lots of power to generate hash for specific block
         > not feasible to go back to change a transaction or data to give themselves more bitcoin as would take lots of energy and time
          > also to succeed they would have to change every block after the genesis up to the block they are changing
           > as blocks are linked or chained by their data - this would takes ridic amounts of energy and time and not feasible whatsoever
